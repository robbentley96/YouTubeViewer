# YouTube Viewer App

## About This Project

This is an Angular web app for making searches on YouTube via the YouTube API. There are set search terms which can be included in search requests and the top results are shown. These videos are then viewable in the app. This app was created as an alternative to the YouTube website as it serves many suggested videos to the user which is not always wanted.
